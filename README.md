# Nginx Project

## Overview

This project sets up an Nginx server with a self-signed SSL certificate.

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSL installed
- Nginx installed

## Steps to Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

Generate a private key:

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key
```

Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

```
openssl req -new -key private.key -out csr.csr
```

Generate the self-signed certificate:

```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.csr -signkey private.key -out certificate.crt
```
